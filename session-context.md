## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY:
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Account Role Created**: Successfully created arn:aws:iam::140023360843:role/cross-account-role in hub account
‚Ä¢ **Role Configuration**: 
  ‚Ä¢ Allows spoke account (609177035700) to assume it
  ‚Ä¢ Has permissions for SSM parameters, EKS describe, and Secrets Manager
  ‚Ä¢ Includes external ID condition: "eks-fleet-management"
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Account Role Trust Policy**: Includes both hub root and SSO role ARNs
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Account Role Assumption Test**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Successfully tested manual role assumption with external ID

### ‚úÖ TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION FIXES:
‚Ä¢ **Spoke Providers Configuration**: Added missing external_id to shared-services provider in spokes/providers.tf
‚Ä¢ **Backend Configuration**: Updated spokes terraform backend to use correct state file path and profile
‚Ä¢ **Hub terraform.tfvars**: Reverted incorrect changes (kept as hub-cluster)
‚Ä¢ **Environment Variables**: Unset AWS env vars to use profile-based authentication

### ‚ùå CURRENT BLOCKER:
‚Ä¢ **Terraform Backend Issue**: S3 backend still showing expired token errors despite:
  - Fresh AWS credentials in profiles
  - Unset environment variables  
  - Cross-account role assumption working manually
  - Backend configured with correct profile

### üîÑ NEXT STEPS WHEN YOU RETURN:

1. **Resolve Backend Authentication Issue**:
   - Verify credentials are truly refreshed
   - Check if there are other AWS env vars interfering
   - Consider alternative backend initialization approach

2. **Test Terraform Plan**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sharmcra/Library/CloudStorage/WorkDocsDrive-Documents/AllProjectsInternal/mkpattern/eks-fleet-management/terraform/spokes
   terraform init -reconfigure
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Deploy Spoke Cluster** (once plan works):
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### üìã Key Information for Reference:

**Accounts:**
‚Ä¢ Hub: 140023360843 (has ArgoCD and cross-account role)
‚Ä¢ Spoke: 609177035700 (target for spoke cluster)

**Cross-Account Role:**
‚Ä¢ ARN: arn:aws:iam::140023360843:role/cross-account-role
‚Ä¢ Purpose: Allows spoke to read hub SSM parameters for ArgoCD registration
‚Ä¢ External ID: "eks-fleet-management" (REQUIRED for assumption)
‚Ä¢ **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - manual assumption test successful

**Architecture Understanding:**
‚Ä¢ Hub has centralized ArgoCD managing both hub and spoke clusters
‚Ä¢ Spoke creates secrets in its own account (remote_spoke_secret = false)
‚Ä¢ Spoke reads hub's pod identity role ARN from hub's SSM parameter
‚Ä¢ Hub's pod identity assumes spoke's argocd role to read spoke secrets

**Files Modified:**
‚Ä¢ `/terraform/spokes/providers.tf` - Added external_id to shared-services provider
‚Ä¢ `/terraform/spokes/providers.tf` - Updated backend config (key + profile)
‚Ä¢ `/terraform/hub/terraform.tfvars` - Reverted incorrect changes

**Spoke Cluster Config:**
‚Ä¢ Name: spoke-np
‚Ä¢ Region: eu-west-2
‚Ä¢ Account: 609177035700
‚Ä¢ VPC: eks-fleet-dev-workload-1
‚Ä¢ Kubernetes: 1.32 with automode enabled

**Current Location:** /Users/sharmcra/Library/CloudStorage/WorkDocsDrive-Documents/AllProjectsInternal/mkpattern/eks-fleet-management/terraform/spokes

**AWS Profiles:**
‚Ä¢ ekshub: For hub account operations
‚Ä¢ eksspoke: For spoke account operations
‚Ä¢ Both profiles should have fresh credentials

The main remaining issue is terraform backend authentication - the cross-account role configuration is correct and tested working!
